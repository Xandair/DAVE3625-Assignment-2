# DAVE3625-Assignment-2
Second Obligatory assignment for Introduction to AI DAVE3625

The chosen use case is use case 1 where we are asked to create an algorithm to predict the future stock prices of Tesla based on their historical stock prices.

For this we have been tasked to find which AI algorithm would work best for this use case. With the options being either Regression or classification.

during research we have figured out that classification algorithms are mainly used to predict what category (generally predetermined categories) said data fits into. This is for example used by email systems to filter certain emails into spam.

Regression however is used to predict continuous values and is more accurately used to try and predict something that hasn't happened yet, usually involving numerical values. With this information it seemed clear cut that for use case 1, regression was the way to go as we wanted to predict future stock prices.
